# GitHub Action for creating and registering SCITT statements with Software Trust Manager and DataTrails

This GitHub Action provides the ability to create and sign [SCITT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scitt/about/) statements using code signing keys protected by DigiCert [Software Trust Manager](https://www.digicert.com/software-trust-manager) and submit these statements to the transparency service operated by [DataTrails](https://www.datatrails.ai/).

## Getting Started

1. Generate a keypair and corresponding end-entity certificate in [Software Trust Manager](https://www.digicert.com/software-trust-manager)
2. [Create an account](https://app.datatrails.ai/signup) at DataTrails and [create an access token](https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/developer-patterns/getting-access-tokens-using-app-registrations/)

## Action Inputs

## `datatrails-client_id`

**Required** The `CLIENT_ID` used to access the DataTrails SCITT APIs

## `datatrails-secret`

**Required** The `SECRET` used to access the DataTrails SCITT APIs

## `subject`

**Required** Unique ID for the collection of statements about an artifact. For more info, see `subject` in the [IETF SCITT Terminology](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture#name-terminology).

### `payload`

**Required** The payload file to be registered on the SCITT Service (SBOM, Scan Result, Attestation, etc.)

### `content-type`

**Required** The payload content type (IANA media type) to be registered on the SCITT Service. For example: `application/spdx+json`

### `signed-statement-file`

**Optional** A required file representing the signed SCITT Statement that will be registered with the SCITT Transparency Service. The parameter is optional, as it provides a default file name.  
See [Signed Statement Issuance and Registration](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture#name-signed-statement-issuance-a)
**Default** 'signed-statement.cbor'

## Secrets

This action requires secrets containing credentials and keypair information be configured. Specifically, the following secrets are required:

### DIGICERT_STM_CERTIFICATE_ID

ID of the certificate and keypair protected in Software Trust Manager

### DIGICERT_STM_API_KEY

The Software Trust Manager API key

### DIGICERT_STM_API_BASE_URI

The base URI of the Software Trust Manager API

### DIGICERT_STM_API_CLIENTAUTH_P12_B64

The base-64 encoded PKCS #12 file for client authentication to the Software Trust Manager API

### DIGICERT_STM_API_CLIENTAUTH_P12_PASSWORD

The password for the PKCS #12 file for client authentication to the Software Trust Manager API
